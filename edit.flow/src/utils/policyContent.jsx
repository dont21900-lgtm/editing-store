                <p>We believe in helping our customers as far as possible, and therefore a liberal cancellation policy.</p>
                <h3>Cancellations</h3>
                <p>Under this policy:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cancellations will be considered only if the request is made within 24 hours of placing the order. However, the cancellation request may not be entertained if the orders have been communicated to the vendors/merchants and they have initiated the process of shipping them.</li>
                    <li>Since our products are digital assets, once the download link has been accessed or the file downloaded, cancellations are not possible.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Refunds</h3>
                <p>Due to the nature of digital goods, we generally do not offer refunds once the product has been downloaded. However, if you face technical issues that prevent you from using the product, please contact our support team within 7 days of purchase. Refunds will be processed on a case-by-case basis and if approved, will be credited to your original payment method within 5-7 working days.</p>
